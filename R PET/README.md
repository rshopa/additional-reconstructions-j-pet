# 2D FBP image reconstruction using R PET

Implementation of 2D FBP for the simulated J-PET scanner, using the open-source R PET package for tomographic data processing and image reconstruction.

The exemplary script in *7mm_x10_y0_z0example.R* containts the usage of [Kernel Density Estimation](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/MASS/html/kde2d.html "documentation from MASS package") from {MASS} package and [inverse Radon transform](https://www.whitman.edu/Documents/Academics/Mathematics/SeniorProject_KaileyBolles.pdf "MATHEMATICS OF MEDICAL IMAGING") from {PET} package.
